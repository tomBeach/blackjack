For my friends and advisors, the design for this game has been controversial...
"The design has nothing to do with the game itself..."
"It's overly complicated..."
"It's not responsive..."

The critiques were valid, but the design was motivated by primarily by curiosity and experimentation.  Why a grid?  Specifically: to explore a thinking-outside-the-box approach to a familiar game, and to encounter and practice a challenging form of DOM manipulation and management.

### grid

The grid is a 12 x 18 table of 50x50px cells.
Game components are generated by defining regions on the grid.
Regions are located via their indexCell (top/left cell located via row and column attributes)
Regions are further defined by width, height and merge attributes
The merge attribute defines whether the region is created from a single spanned cell, or from a collection of neighboring individual cells

### objects

Several object classes were defined:

regions

	hold parameters for cell collections defined by location, size, behavior and other attributes
	example: { name:"pName", type:"text", iR:1,iC:2,iW:3,iH:1, merge:"merge", class:"pBorder_1", value:null };

screens

	hold a collection of region objects that define the look of game-states and player-states
players

	hold name and numeric data for game players and the dealer
	numeric data includes bank and bet values -- the total values of $1, $5 and $10 chips held by player
display

	manages transitions between screens (game-states) and subscreens (player-states)
game

	holds logic for calculating hand and dollar values as the game progresses
